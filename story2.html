        Three years ago I was on my way out to the East, and as an extra day in London was of some importance, I 
        took the Friday evening mail-train to Brindisi instead of the usual Thursday morning Marseilles express. 
        Many people shrink from the long forty-eight-hour train journey through Europe, and the subsequent rush 
        across the Mediterranean on the nineteen-knot Isis or Osiris; but there is really very little discomfort 
        on either the train or the mail-boat, and unless there is actually nothing for me to do, I always like to
        save the extra day and a half in London before I say goodbye to her for one of my longer tramps. This 
        time--it was early, I remember, in the shipping season, probably about the beginning of September--there 
        were few passengers, and I had a compartment in the P. & 0. Indian express to myself all the way from 
        Calais. All Sunday I watched the blue waves dimpling the Adriatic, and the pale rosemary along the 
        cuttings; the plain white towns, with their flat roofs and their bold 'duomos', and the grey-green 
        gnarled olive orchards of Apulia. The journey was just like any other. We ate in the dining-car as often 
        and as long as we decently could. We slept after luncheon; we dawdled the afternoon away with 
        yellow-backed novels; sometimes we exchanged platitudes in the smoking-room, and it was there that I met
        Alastair Colvin.

        Colvin was a man of middle height, with a resolute, well-cut jaw; his hair was turning grey; his 
        moustache was sun-whitened, otherwise he was clean-shaven--obviously a gentleman, and obviously also a 
        preoccupied man. He had no great wit. When spoken to, he made the usual remarks in the right way, and I 
        dare say he refrained from banalities only because he spoke less than the rest of us; most of the time he
        buried himself in the Wagon-lit Company's time-table, but seemed unable to concentrate his attention on
        any one page of it. He found that I had been over the Siberian railway, and for a quarter of an hour he
        discussed it with me. Then he lost interest in it, and rose to go to his compartment. But he came back 
        again very soon, and seemed glad to pick up the conversation again.
        
        Of course this did not seem to me to be of any importance. Most travellers by train become a trifle 
        infirm of purpose after thirty-six hours' rattling. But Colvin's restless way I noticed in somewhat 
        marked contrast with the man's personal importance and dignity; especially ill suited was it to his 
        finely made large hand with strong, broad, regular nails and its few lines. As I looked at his hand I 
        noticed a long, deep, and recent scar of ragged shape. However, it is absurd to pretend that I thought 
        anything was unusual. I went off at five o'clock on Sunday afternoon to sleep away the hour or two that 
        had still to be got through before we arrived at Brindisi.
        
        Once there, we few passengers transhipped our hand baggage, verified our berths--there were only a score 
        of us in all--and then, after an aimless ramble of half an hour in Brindisi, we returned to dinner at the
        Hotel International, not wholly surprised that the town had been the death of Virgil. If I remember 
        rightly, there is a gaily painted hall at the International--I do not wish to advertise am-thine, but 
        there is no other place in Brindisi at which to await the coming of the mails--and after dinner I was 
        looking with awe at a trellis overgrown with blue vines, when Colvin moved across the room to my table. 
        He picked up Il Secolo, but almost immediately gave up the pretence of reading it. He turned squarely to 
        me and said:
