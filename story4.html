        GEOFFREY BETTON woke rather late—so late that the winter sunlight sliding across his warm red carpet 
        struck his eyes as he turned on the pillow.

        
        Strett, the valet, had been in, drawn the bath in the adjoining dressing-room, placed the crystal and 
        silver cigarette-box at his side, put a match to the fire, and thrown open the windows to the bright 
        morning air. It brought in, on the glitter of sun, all the shrill crisp morning noises—those piercing 
        notes of the American thoroughfare that seem to take a sharper vibration from the clearness of the medium
         through which they pass.

        
        Betton raised himself languidly. That was the voice of Fifth Avenue below his windows. He remembered that
         when he moved into his rooms eighteen months before, the sound had been like music to him: the complex 
         orchestration to which the tune of his new life was set. Now it filled him with horror and weariness, 
         since it had become the symbol of the hurry and noise of that new life. He had been far less hurried in 
         the old days when he had to be up by seven, and down at the office sharp at nine. Now that he got up 
         when he chose, and his life had no fixed framework of duties, the hours hunted him like a pack of 
         blood-hounds.

        
        He dropped back on his pillows with a groan. Yes—not a year ago there had been a positively sensuous joy 
        in getting out of bed, feeling under his bare feet the softness of the sunlit carpet, and entering the 
        shining tiled sanctuary where his great porcelain bath proffered its renovating flood. But then a year 
        ago he could still call up the horror of the communal plunge at his earlier lodgings: the listening for 
        other bathers, the dodging of shrouded ladies in “crimping”-pins, the cold wait on the landing, the 
        reluctant descent into a blotchy tin bath, and the effort to identify one’s soap and nail-brush among the 
        promiscuous implements of ablution. That memory had faded now, and Betton saw only the dark hours to 
        which his blue and white temple of refreshment formed a kind of glittering antechamber. For after his 
        bath came his breakfast, and on the breakfast-tray his letters. His letters!

        
        He remembered—and that memory had not faded!—the thrill with which he had opened the first missive in a 
        strange feminine hand: the letter beginning: “I wonder if you’ll mind an unknown reader’s telling you all 
        that your book has been to her?”

        
        Mind? Ye gods, he minded now! For more than a year after the publication of “Diadems and Faggots” the 
        letters, the inane indiscriminate letters of condemnation, of criticism, of interrogation, had poured in 
        on him by every post. Hundreds of unknown readers had told him with unsparing detail all that his book 
        had been to them. And the wonder of it was, when all was said and done, that it had really been so 
        little—that when their thick broth of praise was strained through the author’s anxious vanity there 
        remained to him so small a sediment of definite specific understanding! No—it was always the same thing, 
        over and over and over again—the same vague gush of adjectives, the same incorrigible tendency to 
        estimate his effort according to each writer’s personal preferences, instead of regarding it as a work of
         art, a thing to be measured by objective standards!

        
        He smiled to think how little, at first, he had felt the vanity of it all. He had found a savour even in 
         grosser evidences of popularity: the advertisements of his book, the daily shower of “clippings,” the 
         sense that, when he entered a restaurant or a theatre, people nudged each other and said “That’s Betton.
         ” Yes, the publicity had been sweet to him—at first. He had been touched by the sympathy of his 
         fellow-men: had thought indulgently of the world, as a better place than the failures and the dyspeptics
          would acknowledge. And then his success began to submerge him: he gasped under the thickening shower of 
          letters. His admirers were really unappeasable. And they wanted him to do such preposterous things—to 
          give lectures, to head movements, to be tendered receptions, to speak at banquets, to address mothers,
           to plead for orphans, to go up in balloons, to lead the struggle for sterilized milk. They wanted his 
           photograph for literary supplements, his autograph for charity bazaars, his name on committees, 
           literary, educational, and social; above all, they wanted his opinion on everything: on Christianity, 
           Buddhism, tight lacing, the drug-habit, democratic government, female suffrage and love. Perhaps the 
           chief benefit of this demand was his incidentally learning from it how few opinions he really had: the
           
           
           
           only one that remained with him was a rooted horror of all forms of correspondence. He had been 
           unutterably thankful when the letters began to fall off.

        
        “Diadems and Faggots” was now two years old, and the moment was at hand when its author might have 
        counted on regaining the blessed shelter of oblivion—if only he had not written another book! For it was 
        the worst part of his plight that his first success had goaded him to the perpetration of this particular 
        folly—that one of the incentives (hideous thought!) to his new work had been the desire to extend and 
        perpetuate his popularity. And this very week the book was to come out, and the letters, the cursed 
        letters, would begin again!

        
        Wistfully, almost plaintively, he contemplated the breakfast-tray with which Strett presently appeared. 
        It bore only two notes and the morning journals, but he knew that within the week it would groan under 
        its epistolary burden. The very newspapers flung the fact at him as he opened them.

        
        READY ON MONDAY.
        GEOFFREY BETTON’S NEW NOVEL
        ABUNDANCE.

        A hundred and fifty thousand volumes! And an average of three readers to each! Half a million of people
         would be reading him within a week, and every one of them would write to him, and their friends and 
         relations would write too. He laid down the paper with a shudder.

        
        The two notes looked harmless enough, and the calligraphy of one was vaguely familiar. He opened the 
        envelope and looked at the signature: Duncan Vyse. He had not seen the name in years—what on earth could 
        Duncan Vyse have to say? He ran over the page and dropped it with a wondering exclamation, which the 
        watchful Strett, re-entering, met by a tentative “Yes, sir?”
