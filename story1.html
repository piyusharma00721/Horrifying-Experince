           Joseph Glanville.
           WE had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For some minutes the old man seemed too much 
           exhausted to speak.
                
           “Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest 
           of my sons; but, about three years past, there happened to me an event such as never happened to 
           mortal man—or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of—and the six hours of deadly terror 
           which I then endured have broken me up body and soul. You suppose me a very old man—but I am not. It 
           took less than a single day to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and
           to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you 
           know I can scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?”
                    
           The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the 
           weightier portion of his body hung over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his 
           elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose, a sheer unobstructed precipice of 
           black shining rock, some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us. Nothing 
           would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink. In truth so deeply was I excited by 
           the perilous position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground, clung to the shrubs 
           around me, and dared not even glance upward at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of 
           the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds. It was 
           long before I could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.
           “You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have brought you here that you might have 
           the best possible view of the scene of that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole story with the
           spot just under your eye.”
           
           “We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner which distinguished him—“we are now close 
           upon the Norwegian coast—in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province of Nordland—and 
           in the dreary district of Lofoden. The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now 
           raise yourself up a little higher—hold on to the grass if you feel giddy—so—and look out, beyond the 
           belt of vapor beneath us, into the sea.”
           
           I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at 
           once to my mind the Nubian geographer’s account of the Mare Tenebrarum. A panorama more deplorably 
           desolate no human imagination can conceive. To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, 
           there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly black and beetling cliff, whose
           character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its
           white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex 
           we were placed, and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible a small, 
           bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge
           in which it was enveloped. About two miles nearer the land, arose another of smaller size, hideously 
           craggy and barren, and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.
           
           The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more distant island and the shore, had something 
           very unusual about it. Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that a brig in the 
           remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail, and constantly plunged her whole hull out of 
           sight, still there was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry cross dashing
           of water in every direction—as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little 
           except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.
           
           “The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The 
           one midway is Moskoe. That a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm, 
           Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off—between Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm, 
           Flimen, Sandflesen, and Stockholm. These are the true names of the places—but why it has been
           thought necessary to name them at all, is more than either you or I can understand. Do you 
           hear anything? Do you see any change in the water?”
                    
           We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen, to which we had ascended from 
           the interior of Lofoden, so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon 
           us from the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a loud and gradually increasing 
           sound, like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same
           moment I perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us, was
           rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current 
           acquired a monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its headlong impetuosity. 
           In five minutes the whole sea, as far as Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it 
           was between Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here the vast bed of 
           the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels, burst suddenly into 
           phrensied convulsion—heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and innumerable 
           vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water 
           never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous descents.
                    
           In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another radical alteration. The general 
           surface grew somewhat more smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while 
           prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before. These streaks, at
           length, spreading out to a great distance, and entering into combination, took unto 
           themselves the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the germ of 
           another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this assumed a distinct and definite existence, in 
           a circle of more than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented by a broad 
           belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific 
           funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and 
           jet-black wall of water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees, 
           speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion, and sending forth to 
           the winds an appalling voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract 
           of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.
                    
           The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked. I threw myself upon my face, and 
           clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation.
           “This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of 
           the Maelström.”
           “So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it the Moskoe-ström, from the
           island of Moskoe in the midway.”
                    
           The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what I saw. That of 
           Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest 
           conception either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene—or of the wild 
           bewildering sense of the novel which confounds the beholder. I am not sure from what point of
           view the writer in question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have been 
           from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There are some passages of his 
           description, nevertheless, which may be quoted for their details, although their effect is
           exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.
                   
           “Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the water is between thirty-six and 
           forty fathoms; but on the other side, toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to 
           afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on the rocks, which 
           happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between
           Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea 
           is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts; the noise being heard several 
           leagues off, and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes 
           within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom, and there 
           beat to pieces against the rocks; and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are 
           thrown up again. But these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the ebb and 
           flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its violence gradually 
           returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is 
           dangerous to come within a Norway mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away
           by not guarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens 
           frequently, that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence; and 
           then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings in their fruitless struggles
           to disengage themselves. A bear once, attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught
                      
           by the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore. Large 
           stocks of firs and pine trees, after being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and 
           torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the bottom to 
           consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated 
           by the flux and reflux of the sea—it being constantly high and low water every six hours. 
           In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it raged with such noise and 
           impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”
                    
           In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this could have been ascertained at
           all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex. The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to 
           portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or Lofoden. The depth in the 
           centre of the Moskoe-ström must be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is 
           necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the abyss of the whirl 
           which may be had from the highest crag of Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon 
           the howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the 
           honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and 
           the bears; for it appeared to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of 
           the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly attraction, could resist
           it as little as a feather the hurricane, and must disappear bodily and at once.
                    
           The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I remember, seemed to me 
           sufficiently plausible in perusal—now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The 
           idea generally received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the Ferroe 
           islands, “have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling, at flux and 
           reflux, against a ridge of rocks and shelves, which confines the water so that it 
           precipitates itself like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the
           fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the prodigious suction of 
           which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments.”—These are the words of the Encyclopædia 
           Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the Maelström is
           an abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia 
           being somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle in itself, was the one 
           to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily assented; and, mentioning it to the 
           guide, I was rather surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost 
           universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless was not his own. 
           As to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with
           him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even 
           absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.
                    
           “You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old man, “and if you will creep round 
           this crag, so as to get in its lee, and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story 
           that will convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”
                    
          I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.
                    
          “Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged smack of about seventy tons burthen,
          with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to.
          In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at proper opportunities, if one has 
          only the courage to attempt it; but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were 
          the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands, as I tell you. The 
          usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward. There fish can be got at all 
          hours, without much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The choice spots over 
          here among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in far greater 
          abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the more timid of the craft could not
          scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of desperate speculation—the risk 
          of life standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.
